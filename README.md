# KIDE

The project is taking baby steps. Lot of open source projects are published as soon as they are ready, which means before they're even useful for anything. KIDE is not an exception.

This is a programming environment for python, running on an open source gaming console GCW-Zero. It is accessed from a web browser.

GCW-Zero comes with a really good python environment, which is ready out of the box for game development. That system is easy to learn and use, but many desktop computers do not have a programming environment that could interact with this system. Also they're difficult to install.

KIDE would solve this problem by running on GCW-Zero and being supplied along the console. You could access it on the same local area network where you connect the GCW-Zero to.

Everything's portable code, so it will also run on any other system. But you'd have to install it yourself. Installing software yourself is never really fun, and it's a steep barrier for learning on many systems.
